        <h3>C++ - DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORIOTHM</h3>
        <p class="c++-skill">I started learning to code since i was 15. Actually it all started when
          i picked up the science stream as my subjects and to be specific non-medical
          as my field. Although initially it seems to be like quite a difficult for me
          to understand the coding terms and all but now it seems like i was just slacking
          off and not concentrating onto it attentively.</p>

        <h3>FRONTEND WEB DEVLOPMENT</h3>
        <p class="web-dev-skill">I'm always interested in learning website development because it seems to be very fascinating to me.
          I often thought onto start learning it before but something happens always and i'm not able to kick it off but in the early 2022
          i started learning it and now i wish to learn all the Tech-Stack associated with the Web-Dev in order to acquire the best of the knowledge
          regarding various technologies available in website development.</p>

        <h3>PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p>Photography skills are always the coolest skills anyone could ever have. I

          unless i started clikced pic i realised that it really have a calming effect on me.</p>
